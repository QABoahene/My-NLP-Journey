# Self-Taught Natural Language Processing(NLP)
I am on a journey to teach myself NLP by the end of 2020. However, I will be working on projects from time to time and updating this repository with everything I learn.
I intend to properly document my resources, thought processes and codes so anyone looking to get into NLP can have a good start and benefit from my progress as a beginner.
This Readme is a work in progress so if you're just getting here, well... you found me.

Let's have some fun with words!
