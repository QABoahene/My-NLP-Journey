# Context Maturity
## Background
Listening to Busta Rhyme's new album in 2020, I had a thought. The lyrics of the songs on the album caught my attention because of what he was talking about. Things he talked about were about social justice, politics, black live movements and events surrounding these things. I have been a fan of Busta Rhymes ever since I started listening to Hip Hop, which is a long time ago. This made me wonder how much his lyrics have changed since his first album, mixtape or EP.

So I had an idea, how about analysing the lyrics of each song on his albums and eventually his discography? Maybe that will tell me what I wanted to know and probably why I liked his new album so much. Looking at this discography, he had a lot of projects so I decided to start simple. 

The idea is to pick an artist with an 'ok' amount of albums and have songs that were diverse enough to run experiments on. I ended up with [Jon Bellion](http://www.jonbellion.com/). I am a huge fan so this is still good for me.

## Questions
How has the lyrical content and context changed over time in an artist's discography? What can this say about the *context maturity** of their discography?

* Context maturity is a term I've coined for the study of the changes of the changes in the lyrics of the albums over time contextually.

This can help us ask and answer a lot of questions. Here are a few that was contributed after discussing this project with fellow a data scientist.

Take Kendrick Lamar, he recently won a Pulitzer Award for his Damn album. Taking a look into the context of the lyrics, how does his previous album compare to DAMN and are they worth a Pulitzer? (This depends on how the old albums compare to DAMN) 

Let’s take Kanye West. If you’re a Kanye fan or even not, there’s a chance you’ve come across the argument about how the old Kanye is better, well in terms of musically and personally, or both. But this project can help us understand how different his albums have been and that can give us an insight that can help explain why people likes his old albums than his new ones.

## What Do I Need?
Jon Bellion has a total of five(5) albums. 

- I will need the lyrics of each song on each album. This will be text files containing the lyrics of the songs.
- The complete data should be folders according to the albums with test files of each song in their respective album folders.
- A website to scrape the lyrics of the songs.
- [Genius](https://genius.com/)

## What To Do?
First, I need the data, this will mean I have to scrape it from Genius using the Genius API. 

Put the data together and clean it.

Exploratory Data Analysis with visualisations.

Sentiment Analysis. (Emotions)

Entity Recognition. 

Use Empath model on it. 

Topic Modelling.

Try my hands on summarisation.

Write article about this.

- Address nature of music and lyrics(metaphors and other literary devices)
- The process
- Domain knowledge of maturity evaluation
- The process (NLP for beginners)
- Results with domain knowledge
