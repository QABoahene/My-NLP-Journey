[Verse 1]
Been watching you for months and I'm tryin' to find a way now
To tell you what I'm seeing, it's heavy on my brain now
It's only moving faster, you're only sinking farther
I see it in your eyes now, it's only getting harder

[Chorus]
There's a house she doesn't know that you take care of
There's a light she doesn't know that you keep on
There's a "sorry" that you fake to keep her happy
When she thinks she hasn't seen you in so long
There are things that she's not able to remember
So I took tonight to put it in a song
That when she meets God, He'll tell her all about it
When my mother was a mother to her mom

[Verse 2]
Conversations with the Devil and he's telling me
What's the point in making memories
When you can't even find 'em when you're 70?
Conversations with my Father and he's telling me
There's a point in making memories
'Cause they'll be even better when we're heavenly

[Chorus]
There's a house she doesn't know that you take care of
There's a light she doesn't know that you keep on
There's a "sorry" that you fake to keep her happy
When she thinks she hasn't seen you in so long
There are things that she's not able to remember
So I took tonight to put it in a song
That when she meets God, He'll tell her all about it
When my mother was a mother
When my mother was a mother
When my mother was a mother to her mom
