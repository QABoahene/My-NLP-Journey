[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
You already know how we came up
I'm saying it was a real pain in the butt (Ow)
If it's paper to touch, we may just cut you, scraping it up
Get your trachea cut and then escape in a truck
Smudge a lady makeup, bang the trey-eighty, wake the baby up
I just came for the weight like a gymnasium
I'm finna spray everything in my radius
Lately, my skin been looking radiant
The Mercedes is eighties sent
I have three sixes in my fate like Damien
I'd die before I let the jakes take me in
Babe, we everything we say we is (Facts)
My stable of women couldn't fit in the stadium
They sayin' me and Jon Bellion, we some aliens
And durags had us looking like Saudi Arabians
Your wave miscellaneous, we some ladies men
It's Roc, Marcberg be the alias
Now let's begin

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
Was never focused on gettin' bigger, just gettin' better
That's why I keep gettin' bigger after every record
Said I got lucky, the last record that y'all was blessed with
Watch me give you sequels, I'm Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon
I let the talent speak volumes, that's why there's different levels
I stopped the flexin' on socials, corny shit to impress you
You get too famous, then everything in your life is stressful
There's a big difference 'tween being known and being successful
Great grandfather, an immigrant from the Naples district
Dirty Guinea crew in the cut, call that the true incision
My wife thicker than liquor soaked in Italian biscuits
Cookin' minestron' every Sunday, call that a superstition
I left LA just to cook in Brooklyn, the winter's reaper
I sleep in Timbs and a Yankee fitted, that's just for leisure
I'm really better than everybody pretends to be
So ask the label now, why the fuck would I want an urban feature?
"I love the song and we really wanna know how you made it"
Or I could keep all you wondering how we been creatin'
It's annoying when cameras catchin' your every statement
And I've had enough of these corny artists that replicate it
Champagne supernovas destroy the morning glory
I'd rather build an oasis sober and thrive at 40
Don't get me wrong, I've been celebrating the life before me
But I see the wisdom in moderation for certain stories
When you're afraid to hurt feelings, you water down the worth
I'm done pretending your record's great and I'm down to work
Plus, I'll be actress and mixed with sociopaths
And when I'm worried about being famous for being down to earth
I spoke with Yahweh, he told me Jesus grafted us in
Which means my brother's my brother, it don't matter the skin
America needs to watch how they treat His chosen people
But that's for deeper than surface records, now let's begin

[Chorus: RZA & 
B.Keyz
]
Now let's begin
Yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, uh
Now let's begin

[Verse 3: B.Keyz]
Uh, foot on the gas, foot on your neck, uh
One mashin', other gasping for a breath
I'm unclasped, capital punishment blast backwards
You tumblin', trash rappers who mumblin' for respect
I'm uncheckable, wide open, the foul technical
Go full press, I still glide like Clyde Drexler do
I'm done testin' two times over, I'll get the best of you
Better pay attention, two eyes open wide when I execute
And I been waiting so long that you asked for this
Try to give me your table scraps, I'ma give you my ass to kiss
I won't even wait for the dap, you'll get faded right after this
A masochist who ready to face the masses like Catholics, uh
And you can tell the whole school I'm prepped for the glory
In the presence of your professor, attendance is mandatory
With a weapon, freshman semester, you test the mess, it get gory
I'm just here to kill the game, let the messenger tell the story

[Chorus: RZA]
Now let's begin
Now let's begin

[Outro: Travis Mendes]
Palms in the sky, I'm feeling angel high
Funk got me sanctified (Funk got me sanctified)
Swim to the light, come save your soul tonight
Funk got me sanctified (Uh-huh, oh)
Funk got me sanctified (Sanctified, oh oh)
Funk got me sanctified (Oh, oh)
Palms in the sky, I'm feeling angel high (Palms in the sky, I'm feeling)
Funk got me sanctified (Funk got me sanctified)
Swim to the light, come save your soul tonight
Funk got me sanctified (Oh)
