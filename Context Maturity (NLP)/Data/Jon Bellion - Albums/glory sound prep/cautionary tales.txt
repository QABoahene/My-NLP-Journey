[Verse 1]
Heard he was born as a beast and a ghost
On the East of a coast where they eat you for jokes, uh
I know a guy who said his mom knew a man
Whose mother's sister saw him in the mall one time
Heard he was high and he rode to the sky
And it opened and God played a song he recorded
He wrote it down
But he only play the record for his wife sometimes
Heard he survived, on an island with Vikes
That provided the Valkyries, sirens, and pirates
Don’t know the guy, yeah, uh
But they talk about his verses in the night sometimes

[Chorus]
Big bang, the six, the seven
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the six, the seven
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the king, the legend

[Verse 2]
Heard he was formed from the lights that are Northern
The Rock of Gibraltar, he once got an offer
From Lucifer's daughter to bow to the gods
So he'd keep his verses sharper than a knife sometimes
Heard he was warned that a hero gets torn
Between fame and adornment and loses his sword
So he shot the fame down, uh
But he keep a mask on him if the sign’s in the sky
Heard he was happy so no one could gas him
Or force him to dance like a monkey for assets
He loves his life
But he keep a pen sharp enough to write one time

[Chorus]
Big bang, the six, the seven
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the six, the seven
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the king, the legend

[Bridge]
He struck down gods and he killed an army
Stood up on top of a hill of bodies
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
Put up both hands, made the lightning come down
Rep got so big that it blocked the sun out
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself

[Outro]
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
He just needed saving from himself
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
He just needed (The king, the legend)
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
The king, the legend
Himself
The king, the legend
The king, the legend
