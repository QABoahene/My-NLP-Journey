[Verse 1]
I might have been tired, you might have been hungry
I might have said something, you might have done nothing
You know you still love me
I might have been wired, you probably need coffee
I know I keep chips on my shoulder like dip
So come get it off me

[Chorus]
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come and dance with me
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
Come and dance with me
Come and dance for me (Dance for me, dance for me)

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna get
I wanna get

[Verse 2]
You crashed in my car, I fucked up vacation
I tried to change this and you tried to change that
But it's just in our nature
I desperately care, you're hopelessly on me
I try to stay pissed, and you try to stay mad
'Til I grab your hips softly

[Chorus]
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come and dance with me
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
Come and dance with me
Come and dance for me (Dance for me, dance for me)

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna get
I wanna get

[Bridge]
I wanna get close
Let me get close, let me get close (Close, close, close)
I wanna get close
Let me get close, let me get close (Close, close, close)

[Chorus]
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come and dance with me
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
Come and dance with me
Toda las jevas con cadera, que esto va pa' bajo

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna get
I wanna get (Close)
I wanna get (Close)
