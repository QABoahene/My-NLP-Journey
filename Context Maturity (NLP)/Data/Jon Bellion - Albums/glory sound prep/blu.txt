[Verse 1]
Messing with my pride, thinking anytime
You could just get up and go
Then I realize, what the hell is love
If you're in complete control?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey ma, hey ma, hey, hey ma, hey ma, hey
Come to my house and take me home
Sucked up by the wave, shot to outer space
Stranded, but I'm not alone

[Chorus]
Fall into your blue
Fall into your blue
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like He designed me to do
Fall into your blue

[Verse 2]
Sunrise in your bed, purple, yellow, red
Only when it's you and me
Take me to the edge, drag me through your lens
Show me what I need to see

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey ma, hey ma, hey, hey ma, hey ma, hey
Come to my house and take me home
Avenues and lanes, parachutes and planes
Push me out, away we go

[Chorus]
Fall into your blue
Fall into your blue
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like He designed me to do
Fall into your blue

[Bridge]
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
(Come to my house and take me home)
Come to my house and take me home
(Come to my house and take me home)
Come to my house and take me home

[Chorus]
Fall into your blue
(Come to my house and take me home)
Fall into your blue
(Come to my house and take me home)
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like He designed me to do
Fall into your blue
