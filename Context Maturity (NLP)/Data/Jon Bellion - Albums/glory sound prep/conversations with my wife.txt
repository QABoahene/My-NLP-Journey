[Pre-Chorus]
I dreamt I slept on a sidewalk, but you still laid with me
I dreamt I fell in a lion's den, and you still came for me
I dreamt I lost all of my faith, and you still prayed for me
Who the fuck cares about these plaques on my wall?
You're still the only thing I've done right

[Chorus]
Will you love me when my phone turns off?
I don't want to be some digital Jesus
No more followers, we'll both get lost
When it's me and you inside real life
Will you love me when my phone turns off?
I don't want to be some digital Jesus
No more followers, we'll both get lost
When it's me and you inside real life
I just want me and you inside real life
(I just want me and you inside real life)

[Bridge]
They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright
(They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright)
I'm so ready to run from the spotlight
(So ready to run from the spotlight)
They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright
(They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright)
I'm so ready to run from the spotlight

[Pre-Chorus]
I dreamt I slept on a sidewalk, but you still laid with me
Who the fuck cares about these...
I dreamt I fell in a lion's den, and you still came for me
Who the fuck cares about these...
I dreamt I lost all of my faith, and you still prayed for me
Who the fuck cares about these plaques on my wall?
You're still the only thing I've done right

[Chorus]
Will you love me when my phone turns off?
I don't want to be some digital Jesus
No more followers, we'll both get lost
When it's me and you inside real life
Will you love me when my phone turns off?
I don't want to be some digital Jesus
No more followers, we'll both get lost
When it's me and you inside real life
I just want me and you inside real life
(I just want me and you inside real life)
(Ahhh)

[Outro]
(Ahhh)
They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright
I'm so ready to run from the spotlight
