[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Life became dangerous the day we all became famous
No one cares if you're happy, just as long as you claim it, oh
How can we change this? The day we all became famous
No one cares if you have it, just as long they think you do, ooh

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the foot, just need you to think I kick it
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the wood, just need you to think I hit it
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the good, just need you to think I did it
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the good, don't need the good, don't need no

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Life became dangerous the day we all became famous
No one cares if you're happy, just as long as you claim it, oh
How can we change this? The day we all became famous
No one cares if you have it, just as long they think you do, ooh

[Chorus: Jon Bellion & 
Travis Mendes
]
Just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do, ooh, uh
Just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the word, just need you to think I said it
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need to learn, just need you to think I get it
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the sermon, just need you to think I read it
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the sermon, don't need the sermon, don't need it

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Life became dangerous the day we all became famous
No one cares if you're happy, just as long as you claim it, oh
How can we change this? The day we all became famous
No one cares if you have it, just as long they think you do, ooh

[Chorus: Jon Bellion & 
Travis Mendes

Just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do, ooh, uh
Just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do

[Bridge: Jon Bellion]
No real estate in the real world
How can you stop something not even there?
No real estate in the real world
We're going down and we don't even care
(Life became dangerous)
No real estate in the real world
(The day we all became famous)
How can you stop something not even there?
(How can we change this?)
No real estate in the real world
(No one cares if you have it)

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Just as long they think you do, woo
Just as long they think you do, ooh
Uh, just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do
