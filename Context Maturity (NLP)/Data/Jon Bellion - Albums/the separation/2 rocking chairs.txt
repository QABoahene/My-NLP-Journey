[Hook]
Yeah, I built them with my own 2 hands
I carved your name in one
And my name in the other
I built them with my own 2 hands
They're over there, two rocking chairs

[Verse 1]
Leaves fall, rain dries
Snow melts, fame dies
Four words, simply
Grow old, with me

[Pre-Hook]
And when the day comes
When we can't walk no more
We'll have 2 seats, on my front porch
I'll still call you young girl
So young girl, rock with me

[Hook]
Yeah, I built them with my own 2 hands
I carved your name in one
And my name in the other
I built them with my own 2 hands
They're over there, two rocking chairs

[Verse 2]
No watch, no time
Just life and your eyes
Four words, simply
Grow old with me

[Pre-Hook]
And when the day comes
When we can't walk no more
We'll have 2 seats, on my front porch
I'll still call you young girl
So young girl, rock with me

[Hook]
Yeah, I built them with my own 2 hands
I carved your name in one
And my name in the other
I built them with my own 2 hands
They're over there, two rocking chairs

[Outro]
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Just rock with me
Just rock with me
