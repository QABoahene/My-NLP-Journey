[Verse 1]
Yes, I came up with my people
And they love what I've become
As our enemies retreat, watch them run
I'm the storyline of Simba
As we watch the rising sun
Living prophecy is me, Kingdom Come

[Pre-Hook]
On the balcony
With a light skin queen by my side
Rides like Valkyrie
Let the future fall in place
While we are young, young, young, young
Young, young, young, young
I say to my queen
We've just begun, gun, gun, gun, gun
Kingdom Come

[Hook]
Demons seem so small
There the same one's that I've fought in all my nightmares
And conquered in my dreams, we have won
As I watched them fall
I begin to realize my only enemy is me
Kingdom Come, Kingdom Come

[Verse 2]
I heard melodies from angels
So I played them, I'm the one
Now my heroes asking me where I'm from
I'm the storyline of Simba
As we watch the rising sun
Living prophecy is me, Kingdom Come

[Pre-Hook]
On the balcony
With a light skin queen by my side
Rides like Valkyrie
Let the future fall in place
While we are young, young, young, young
Young, young, young, young
I say to my queen
We've just begun, gun, gun, gun, gun
Kingdom Come

[Hook]
Demons seem so small
There the same one's that I've fought in all my nightmares
And conquered in my dreams, we have won
As I watched them fall
I begin to realize my only enemy is me
Kingdom Come, Kingdom Come
