[Intro]
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Your father said he would break my legs
If I ever came around again
I don't mind risking the wheelchair
If we could get another round in

[Pre-Hook]
Oh, you told him you would stay away
But here you are, I kiss your face
You touch my chest, I feel your legs
We're in too far (Yeah!) I hear you say (Yeah!)

[Hook]
One more time
(I need you, I need you, I need you)
One more time
(I need you, I need you, I need you)

[Verse 2]
It's dangerous in the action sequence
And I'm ready to die hard
It's like we're stuck in an 80's movie
As you're sneaking into my car

[Pre-Hook]
Oh, you told him you would stay away
But here you are, I kiss your face
You touch my chest, I feel your legs
We're in too far (Yeah!) I hear you say (Yeah!)

[Hook]
One more time
(I need you, I need you, I need you)
One more time
(I need you, I need you, I need you)

[Bridge]
As we wake up in my car, you're on my chest
Oh, and you got ninety missed calls, one hundred texts
Screw your pops, let's get some IHOP
Screw your pops, let's get some IHOP
Screw your pops, let's get some IHOP
But before we go, you tell me that we should do it

[Hook]
One more time
(I need you, I need you, I need you)
One more time
(I need you, I need you, I need you)
