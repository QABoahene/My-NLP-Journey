[Pre-Hook]
Cocaine like the kid was born in '84
How long you really plan to sleep on me for?
When I decide to put my cape on the floor
Superman won't save you no more

[Verse 1]
Your favorite rapper's be taking beats that I'm shitting up
Your favorite lyricist's tell me that I don't spit enough
10 steps ahead of you musically, how you plan to stop me?
Just count your blessings that I consider rap a fucking hobby!

[Pre-Hook]
Cocaine like the kid was born in '84
How long you really plan to sleep on me for?
When I decide to put my cape on the floor
Superman won't save you no more

[Hook]
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more, more, more—

[Verse 2]
Imagine locking the tone of Sarah McLachlan
The fashion of Jimi Hendrix in a box with the bible's doctrine
I look for potential wives, she looking for famous Johnson
She hungry for the action, in New York we call that Bronson

[Pre-Hook]
Cocaine like the kid was born in '84
How long you really plan to sleep on me for?
When I decide to put my cape on the floor
Superman won't save you no more

[Hook]
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more, more, more—

[Interlude]

[Hook]
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more

[Bridge]
She literally told me:
"You're too much of a genius"
"You're gonna be too famous"
She literally left me—
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse
She literally told me:
"You're too much of a genius"
"You're gonna be too famous"
She literally left me—
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse

[Outro]
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse
