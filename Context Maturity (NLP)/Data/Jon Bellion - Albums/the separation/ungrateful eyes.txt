[Verse 1]
I made a hundred grand this year
(
Clap clap, clap clap, so what?
)
Still lost, still feeling anxious
Still worry 'bout the same shit
I made a hundred grand this year
(
Clap clap, clap clap, so what?
)
Still lost, still feel depressed like
I'm tryna find a way in

[Pre-Hook]
I'm tryna figure this out
But my god, I'm so human
And so I turned to my sister and smiled
And asked this question

[Hook]
All we wanna know is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop—ever stop to watch them shine?
All we wanna know is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop—ever stop to watch them shine?
Or are we staring with—staring with ungrateful eyes?

[Verse 2]
I made a hundred grand this year
(
Clap clap, clap clap, so what?
)
Still hung up on opinions, still tryna find a way home
I made a hundred grand this year
(
Clap clap, clap clap, so what?
)
Still feel like I'm behind time, still worry where the day goes

[Pre-Hook]
I'm tryna figure this out
But my god, I'm so human
And so I turned to my sister and smiled
And asked this question

[Hook]
All we wanna know is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop—ever stop to watch them shine?
All we wanna know is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop—ever stop to watch them shine?
Or are we staring with—staring with ungrateful eyes?
All we wanna know is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop—ever stop to watch them shine?
All we wanna know is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop—ever stop to watch them shine?
Or are we staring with—staring with ungrateful eyes?
