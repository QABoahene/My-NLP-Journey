[Verse 1]
(Oh yeah)
Anxiety dance across my pillow case
My god it dances—it’s like, 1, 2 step
It’s asking stupid questions
Like, "Are you living right?"
Such stupid questions
Because I'm just trying to—

[Pre-Hook]
I'm trying live, I'm trying rise
Above the shit, the devil tries
Which is why I keep my eyes to the sky

[Hook]
Insert something really dope right here
I’m supposed to write a hook but all I wanna say is
I just want to be happy (I just want to be happy)
Want to be happy (Yeah)
I’m supposed to write a f’ing hook right here
Money and riches blah blah yeah yeah
I just want to be happy (I just want to be happy)
Want to be happy (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I've been working my ass off
That’s why Christina left me
Been working my ass off
On this project, but I guess that it’s okay
My family never liked you, I guess that it’s okay
Now I’m just, I’m just—

[Pre-Hook]
I’m trying live I'm trying rise
Above the shit the devil tries
Which is why I keep my eyes to the sky

[Hook]
Insert something really dope right here
I’m supposed to write a hook but all I wanna say is
I just want to be happy
(I just want to be happy)
Want to be happy (Yeah)
I’m supposed to write a f’ing hook right here
Money and riches blah blah yeah yeah
I just want to be happy
(I just want to be happy)
Want to be happy (Yeah)

[Verse 3:]
Listen boo boo, bear with me (yeah)
Smarter than your average
Raised around Brooklyn based Italian
There’s so much soul up in my Johnson
I don’t need a rapper on it
Because the urbans in my testes
But I come in pop packaging (Yikes)
Bunch of pricks talk shit, we call that cactusing
We don’t want no fight club don’t want no Brad Pitt’in
Braymance like this shit just when I'm ad-libbin'
Fronting on my Sean Penn what movie are you actin in?
Seventh grade I said "I’m bout to leave the masses then"
My ex-girlfriend's sister said “you babbling”
Even back then cook crack, drug trafficking

[Outro]
I'm trying live, I'm trying rise
Above the shit, the devil tries
Which is why I keep my eyes to the sky
You’re gonna be okay kid, you’re gonna be, okay
