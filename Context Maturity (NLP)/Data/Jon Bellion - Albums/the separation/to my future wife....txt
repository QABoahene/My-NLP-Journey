[Verse 1]
Open up the doors in the back of the church
And they all rise, they all rise
Take a couple steps of my breath in a dress
That is all white, it's all white
As your father lets you go
He will whisper soft and slow

[Chorus]
"Walk towards love," yeah
"Walk towards love," yeah
"Walk towards love"

[Verse 2]
This money's gonna come
And this money's gonna go
But that's alright, that's alright
'Cause everything could fall down
Everything can go
But it's all fine, it's all fine
They say love's a winding road
But it's simple if we both

[Chorus]
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love

[Verse 3]
Even the philosophers know, its a fact
That we all die, we all die
I know you're an angel
So if they call you back
In a short time, a short time
And you leave me in this life
I will follow close behind

[Chorus]
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, hum
