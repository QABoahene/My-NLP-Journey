[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Her body is cold, the conversation is cocaine
I'll call her Snow (Yeah, that's your new nickname)
Her body is cold, the conversation is cocaine
I'll call her snow (What up, Snow?)

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Yeah, what up to Snow
She always keep it funky like afros
A little bit of panic 'cause my heart's Titanic
Like, oh, we so DiCaprio
Yeah, what up to Snow
She always keep it funky like afros
A little bit of panic 'cause my heart's Titanic
Like, oh, we so DiCaprio

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
She knows more than me about Dragon Ball Z
How cold is that? How cold is that?
(Yeah, that's pretty cold, son)
She's so Andre to me, she's 3000 degrees
How cold is that? how cold is that?
(I, I think that she's ice cold then, right?)
I'm making music in a blue room
She walks in in black lingerie
And she likes Italian white kids
So when we hit the bedroom, we turning Fifty Shades of Grey
Nickname stuck, now she won't let it go
So now I'm undercover screaming, "Let it snow!"
Now we rubbing noses like we Eskimos
Beautiful Mind, you already know

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Her body is cold, the conversation is cocaine
I'll call her Snow (Yeah, that's your new nickname)
Her body is cold, the conversation is cocaine
I'll call her snow (What up, Snow?)

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Yeah, what up to Snow
She always keep it funky like afros
A little bit of panic 'cause my heart's Titanic
Like, oh, we so DiCaprio
Yeah, what up to Snow
She always keep it funky like afros
A little bit of panic 'cause my heart's Titanic
Like, oh, we so DiCaprio

[Verse 2: Blaque Keyz]
Beautiful Mind, yeah
Say "Hello" to the woman frozen like pose in a tundra
I wonder if I propose, will she open up like umbrellas
Or will she close, I would hope that you were in the know
Cause that dress is wrapping around her like plastic on bags of blow
She so classic, I never pass it, so passionate, making racket
When raggin', grabbin' her toes, a total package and all
Never get in your face about movin' in steady paces
Throw those other broads away, just so her waist don't go to waste
I'm the detective on this case, but I've defected on this record
Investigating a case and pursuing her in a chase
I might ruin her when I'm through with her, but only she would know
If I broke her heart into pieces and dropped it when it was frozen
And I'm a snowman, we hold hands, I melt when she gets close
Grabbin' my carrot, I'm an addict for this habit I have chosen
As the weather's getting warmer and the season is done
I'ma make sure to keep you on the tip of my tongue

[Outro: Jon Bellion]
I'll call her snow
She's so cold, ba bada ba
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll call her snow
I'll call her snow
