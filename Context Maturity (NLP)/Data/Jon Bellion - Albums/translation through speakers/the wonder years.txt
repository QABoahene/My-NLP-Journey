[Verse 1]
Before the war, before the lives
Before my brother left that night, yeah
I was just a kid, I was singing la la la la la la la la
Shit was simple just like la la la la la la la la
Yeah, before I grasped that people died
Before I saw my sister cry, yeah
I was just a kid, I was singing la la la la la la la la
Shit was simple just like la la la la la la la la

[Chorus]
So take me back to the days when I was younger
All this bullshit is overrated
Back to the days, pour some shots out with my people
And we gon’ sing like la la la la la la la la
At our local bar like la la la la la la la la

[Verse 2]
Before the world turned gray and old
Before we both fell out of love
We were just kids, we were singing la la la la la la la la
Love was simple just like la la la la la la la la
Before they put our dreams in jail
Before we lost our fairy tales, oh
We were just kids, we were singing la la la la la la la la
Love was simple just like la la la la la la la

[Chorus]
So take me back to the days when I was younger
All this bullshit is overrated
Back to the days, pour some shots out with my people
And we gon’ sing like la la la la la la la la
At our local bar like la la la la la la la la

[Bridge]
They say my dream is unreal
I’m forgettin' how the sun feels
I’m forgettin' how love heals
And my niece is blowing bubbles in the yard
Economy is down, too
They're lying on the damn news
People murdering for damn shoes
And my niece is blowing bubbles in the yard
Think about it, my niece is blowing bubbles in the yard
My niece is blowing bubbles in the yard
Think about it, niece is blowin' bubbles in the yard, yeah

[Chorus]
So take me back to the days when I was younger
All this bullshit is overrated
Back to the days, pour some shots out with my people
And we gon’ sing like la la la la la la la la
At our local bar like la la la la la la la la
