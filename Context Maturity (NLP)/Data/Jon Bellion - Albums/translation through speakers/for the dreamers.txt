[Intro: Jon Bellion]
Like some dope shit, ohh la da da da da da
Like mad people, is it ohh la da da da da da?
Yeah, exactly, exactly
Ohh la da da da da da
Ohh la da da da da da
Ohh la da da da da da
Ohh

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
Yeah, see, it went from talking shit loud
Then graduating to whispers
Still chilling painting pictures with the hipsters
And since I produced the record, please hold while I insert
A bassline dirtier than kissing on your sister (ew)
Still clearing 30 racks, cigarettes, and leather jackets
Pimp coats, and feathered hats
Lose the phone, never that
My mother's cooking sauce
I'm more Italian than Sinatra's kids
Fashion is a chore to me, I'm partying in moccasins
Rocking with the scholars, then we shots up with the college kids
Please don't try and copy me, you're cheating while I'm proctoring
Positively optimistic, hopping on the opposite
Of every single thing they ever told me to do
So put the hate down and watch me spazz out
To sounds that John Lennon would be proud of
Put the hate down and watch me spazz out
To sounds that Jon Lennon would be proud

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Oh, as I take off on an aeroplane
I realize the dream that I'm chasing is true
Yes, I'm afraid of heights, but I'm not afraid to fly

[Post-Chorus]
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh la da da da da da
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh la da da da da da
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh la da da da da da
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh

[Verse 2: Blaque Keyz]
Yeah, for a proper introduction
This is Keyz without the locksmith
A new year, I'm tired of rapping on that nonchalant tip
You scholars think you can roast my associate with hot shit?
You're hopeless, 'cause this bachelor is a master when a doc spits
Work all day and lay back collecting bills at night
We're fly enough to make the sell see us, still we're fearing heights
Waiting to blow, getting impatient
I've been chasing Mr. Myers with a knife
Flipping the script because I'm killing mics
My entourage is a bunch of guys who walk around
Mauling over moms in every mall with their sharpened claws
Not talking Santa or a certain type of grammar
I'm a standout, not handing handouts to all your open paws
So put the hate down and watch me spazz out
To sounds that Kurtis Blow would be proud of
Put the hate down and watch me spazz out
To sounds that Kurtis Blow would be proud

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Oh, as I take off on an aeroplane
I realize the dream that I'm chasing is true
Yes, I'm afraid of heights, but I'm not afraid to fly

[Post-Chorus]
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh la da da da da da
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh la da da da da da
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh la da da da da da
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh

[Outro]
Never wake up from your dreams
Your dreams, your dreams, your dreams, your dreams, yeah
Never wake up from your dreams
Your dreams, your dreams, your dreams, your dreams, yeah
Never wake up from your dreams
Your dreams, your dreams, your dreams, your dreams, yeah
Never wake up from your dreams
Your dreams, your dreams, your dreams, your dreams, yeah
Never wake up from your dreams
