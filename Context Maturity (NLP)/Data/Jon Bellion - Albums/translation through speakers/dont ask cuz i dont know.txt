[Verse 1]
Yeah, see, check the bounce out
Welcome to the dope flow, welcome to the bounce, mane
Live inside my music, so welcome to my house, mane
Welcome, I'm a beat carpenter, and I'm a wordsmith
Welcome to that brand-spanking-new-you-never-heard shit
Welcome to the kid that bring a industry a new day
But some hater chefs cooking bullshit souffle
Welcome to the grindstone, welcome to the pipe dream
Bounced up out of college 'cause I'm taking care of my dream
Welcome to the definition of a frickin; lab rat
With just a dream, and a dollar, and a backpack
But all he cares about is family and good tunes
So don't ask him 'bout his next move

[Chorus]
I haven't even picked out my socks
How could I tell you about my future
Tell you 'bout my future
How could I tell you, t-t-tell you bout
Please don't ask me what my next move is
'Cause I just don't know
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know, yeah
Middle finger to the sky like this
'Cause I just don't know
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
We just don't know, we just don't know, yeah
We just don't know, we just don't know

[Verse 2]
Beautiful Mind
Welcome to the positive, negatives a no-go
Young Sensei building up his dojo
Young Boston, got the smile and the mojo
He dreams yachts while he's sleeping in a rowboat
Almost there, almost there, so we go-go
Go, go, stop, stop. Stop, stop? No, no
I'm a Wizard of the odd, Toto
Dancing with a Dorothy, telling her to go slow
Dancing with a Dorothy, telling her to go slow
Dancing with a Dorothy, telling her to, telling her to

[Chorus]
I haven't even picked out my socks
How could I tell you about my future
Tell you 'bout my future
How could I tell you, t-t-tell you bout
Please don't ask me what my next move is
'Cause I just don't know
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know, yeah
Middle finger to the sky like this
'Cause I just don't know
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know, yeah

[Outro]
'Cause I just don't know
'Cause I just don't know
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know, yeah
We just don't know, we just don't know, yeah
We just don't know, we just don't know
