[Intro]
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Beautiful Mind, Mind, Mind
She's literally like five feet away from me
While I'm recording this, sleeping on the couch
This is for her, sleepy ass

[Verse 1]
I wrote this while I'm watching you sleep (you sleep)
You're behind me on the couch in the studio
So I'm gonna make this lullaby sweet (lullaby sweet)
And soft so I don't wake you up
You're smiling as you sleep so you dig it
Only I can make some soft shit and rip it
I knew that you were dope from the jump like ribbit
'Cause all these other girls fall short like midgets

[Chorus]
The Sandman gon' flip when he come through
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
The Sandman gon' flip when he come through
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to

[Verse 2]
I wrote this while I'm watching you sleep (you sleep)
Your hair is all over the place and I love it
I won't put the bass in this beat (this beat)
If it knocks, then I might wake you up
You're smiling as you sleep, so you like it
She just let me work 'cause she know I cook diamonds
She know I'm paid, but she still nine-to-five-ing
That's why she allowed to hang while I'm writing

[Chorus]
The Sandman gon' flip when he come through
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
The Sandman gon' flip when he come through
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to

[Bridge]
Dopest musical breakdown ever, ready?
If I make this, then maybe you will wake up and get naked
Girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm playing, maybe not
I make this, then maybe you will wake up and get naked
Girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm playing, maybe not
If I make this, then maybe you will wake up and get naked
Girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm playing, maybe not
I make this, then maybe you will wake up and
Wake up and get, wake up and get, yah, yah
Wake up and get, wake up and get, yah, yah
Wake up and get, wake up and get, yah, yah
Wake up and get, wake up and get, yah, yah

[Outro]
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Ah, look who finally decided to wake up
