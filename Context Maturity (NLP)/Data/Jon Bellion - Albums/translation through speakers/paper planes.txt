[Verse 1]
Oh, that ass, it was so first class
She was my co-pilot with a mile high swag
We would smoke all night just flying high like that
(Smoke, smoke all night just flying high like, high like)
I needed her, I knew she needed me
If we fly this thing, it's gonna take two people
But the storm came fast, got a little rocky
The oxygen masks from the ceiling, they were dropping

[Chorus]
We started to fall right out the sky without a warning call
We started to fall, no parachute
So we had no time to call for mayday, mayday
We booked two tickets down to paradise
One last flight tryna make it right
But that's when the rain came, that's when the pain came
Were never ever gonna make it fly
We booked two tickets down to paradise
One last flight tryna make it right
But love came like a hurricane and we were just a paper plane
I know we tried to fly away, yeah
But we were just a paper plane

[Verse 2]
It's funny how things end up, it's funny how we break it off
Relationships they nose dive while one's career is taking off
Publishing checks and fake smiles as I see my dad
My pockets getting filled, but really, emptiness is all I have
We crash, and now there's spare parts
Bandages, and bad scars
We're trying to mend broke Amelia Earharts
And keep trying to fly on, fly on, fly on
But I'm missing my right wing, my right arm, and that's you

[Chorus]
We started to fall right out the sky without a warning call
We started to fall, no parachute
So we had no time to call for mayday, mayday
We booked two tickets down to paradise
One last flight tryna make it right
But that's when the rain came, that's when the pain came
Were never ever gonna make it fly
We booked two tickets down to paradise
One last flight tryna make it right
But love came like a hurricane and we were just a paper plane
I know we tried to fly away, yeah
But we were just a paper plane
