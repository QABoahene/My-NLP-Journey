[Verse 1]
It's so empty right where your head sleeps
And she said "I still smell your cologne in my bed sheets"

[Pre-Chorus]
So I said "I'm just texting you to see how you're ho-holding on"
Then she said, "Some days, I'm okay
But when I'm alone, it hurts because..."

[Chorus]
The-the-the loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
The-the-the loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves

[Verse 2]
When did love letters get lost in translation?
Translation, translation
I heard you took the train from Penn Station
Penn Station, Penn Station

[Pre-Chorus]
So I said "I'm just texting you to see how you're ho-holding on"
Then she said, "Some days, I'm okay
But when I'm alone, it hurts because..."

[Chorus]
The-the-the loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
The-the-the loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
The-the-the loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
The-the-the loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves

[Verse 3]
I have to tape my mouth, I want to ask you questions
Like, "Do you sleep alone? I heard there's friends you rest with"
So I text her friend like, "Tell me where this man's at"
She said, "You got some balls, you don't deserve to ask that"
Oh, oh, they gotta be lying, I'm dying to know
But I know you're not mine, so I, I can't say shit

[Pre-Chorus]
So I said "I'm just texting you to see how you're ho-holding on"
Then she said, "Some days, I'm okay
But when I'm alone, it hurts because..."

[Chorus]
(The loneliness comes in waves)
Waves, waves, waves
(The loneliness comes in, yeah )
Waves, waves, waves
(The loneliness comes in, comes in, comes in)
Waves, waves, waves
The loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
The loneliness comes in waves
