[Verse 1]
22 and confused
On what to do and how to set it up
Kind of drunk, sort of high
She's a broken Miss America
Never learned how to love
'Cause the answers are stuck behind closed doors
You can call it a night
When the lights in the club don't shine no more
When the lights in the club don't shine no more
When the lights in the club don't shine no more

[Chorus]
She wrote it on the bathroom wall in her favorite shade of lipstick
L-I-F-E
She wrote it on the bathroom wall in her favorite shade of lipstick
L-I-F-E, L-I-F-E
Oh oh, she just tryna figure out L-I-F-E, L-I-F-E
Oh oh, we're just tryna figure out

[Verse 2]
Only dreams 'bout the lights, so he's having trouble getting up
He's convinced only Kanye knows how to make it in America
Never learned how to love
'Cause the answers are stuck in all of the lights, all of the lights
He will call it a night
When the lights in the studio shine no more
When the lights in the studio shine no more, yeah
Oh oh, when the lights in the studio shine no more

[Chorus]
She wrote it on the bathroom wall in her favorite shade of lipstick
L-I-F-E
She wrote it on the bathroom wall in her favorite shade of lipstick
L-I-F-E, L-I-F-E
Oh oh, she just tryna figure out L-I-F-E, L-I-F-E
Oh oh, we're just tryna figure out L-I-F-E
Oh oh, she just tryna figure out L-I-F-E, L-I-F-E
Oh oh, we're just tryna figure out

[Outro]
She wrote it on the bathroom wall in her favorite shade of lipstick
L-I-F-E
She wrote it on the bathroom wall in her favorite shade of lipstick
L-I-F-E, L-I-F-E
Oh oh, she just tryna figure out L-I-F-E, L-I-F-E
Oh oh, I'm just tryna figure out
