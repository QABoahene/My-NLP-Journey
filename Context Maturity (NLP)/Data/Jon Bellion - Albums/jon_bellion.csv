You know, maybe I'm drunk, maybe I'm not

Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest

'Cause my sister has a best friend

'Cause we tangled in the sheets
My homies like, ""Dead man, dead man walking""
My homies like, ""You a dead man, dead man walking""

Yeah, uh, come on
Beautiful family friend is she
Almost a decade older than me
And I've been gone for quite a while overseas, yeah
And she's been living up in Albany, yeah yeah

And then from there it was, you know, what I'm saying

Now she's like, ""Damn, how did we let this happen?
Damn, how did we end up in this bed?""
Then I said, ""Relax"" and laughed like
""This would be a pretty dope song.""
She's like, ""No, I swear to God I'll kill you
No, I really will just take your life
No, don't even think about it
But that would be a pretty dope song""
So I came home and I called my friends
Then we got smacked and I wrote this jam
I know for a fact that we going

Yeah, exactly, exactly
Ohh la da da da da da
Ohh la da da da da da
Ohh la da da da da da
Ohh

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
Yeah, see, it went from talking shit loud
Then graduating to whispers
Still chilling painting pictures with the hipsters
And since I produced the record, please hold while I insert
A bassline dirtier than kissing on your sister (ew)
Still clearing 30 racks, cigarettes, and leather jackets
Pimp coats, and feathered hats
Lose the phone, never that
My mother's cooking sauce
I'm more Italian than Sinatra's kids
Fashion is a chore to me, I'm partying in moccasins
Rocking with the scholars, then we shots up with the college kids
Please don't try and copy me, you're cheating while I'm proctoring
Positively optimistic, hopping on the opposite
Of every single thing they ever told me to do
So put the hate down and watch me spazz out
To sounds that John Lennon would be proud of
Put the hate down and watch me spazz out
To sounds that Jon Lennon would be proud

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Oh, as I take off on an aeroplane
I realize the dream that I'm chasing is true
Yes, I'm afraid of heights, but I'm not afraid to fly

[Post-Chorus]

Ohh la da da da da da

[Verse 2: Blaque Keyz]
Yeah, for a proper introduction
This is Keyz without the locksmith
A new year, I'm tired of rapping on that nonchalant tip
You scholars think you can roast my associate with hot shit?
You're hopeless, 'cause this bachelor is a master when a doc spits
Work all day and lay back collecting bills at night
We're fly enough to make the sell see us, still we're fearing heights
Waiting to blow, getting impatient
I've been chasing Mr. Myers with a knife
Flipping the script because I'm killing mics
My entourage is a bunch of guys who walk around
Mauling over moms in every mall with their sharpened claws
Not talking Santa or a certain type of grammar
I'm a standout, not handing handouts to all your open paws
So put the hate down and watch me spazz out
To sounds that Kurtis Blow would be proud of
Put the hate down and watch me spazz out
To sounds that Kurtis Blow would be proud

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Oh, as I take off on an aeroplane
I realize the dream that I'm chasing is true
Yes, I'm afraid of heights, but I'm not afraid to fly

paper planes,translation_through_speakers,"February 20, 2013","[Verse 1]
Oh, that ass, it was so first class
She was my co-pilot with a mile high swag
We would smoke all night just flying high like that
(Smoke, smoke all night just flying high like, high like)
I needed her, I knew she needed me
If we fly this thing, it's gonna take two people
But the storm came fast, got a little rocky
The oxygen masks from the ceiling, they were dropping

[Chorus]
We started to fall right out the sky without a warning call
We started to fall, no parachute
So we had no time to call for mayday, mayday
We booked two tickets down to paradise
One last flight tryna make it right
But that's when the rain came, that's when the pain came
Were never ever gonna make it fly
We booked two tickets down to paradise
One last flight tryna make it right
But love came like a hurricane and we were just a paper plane
I know we tried to fly away, yeah
But we were just a paper plane

[Verse 2]
It's funny how things end up, it's funny how we break it off
Relationships they nose dive while one's career is taking off
Publishing checks and fake smiles as I see my dad
My pockets getting filled, but really, emptiness is all I have
We crash, and now there's spare parts
Bandages, and bad scars
We're trying to mend broke Amelia Earharts
And keep trying to fly on, fly on, fly on
But I'm missing my right wing, my right arm, and that's you

We started to fall right out the sky without a warning call

Fell asleep I had a kick-ass dream
Me, Frank Sinatra, James Dean
Sammy Davis at the bar drinking Moonshine
Nice women, white wine, chillin' poolside
So I asked, ""When will it be my time?""
They said, ""Boy, don't even look at the clock
'Cause you're gonna be timeless""
They said, ""Boy, don't even look at the clock
'Cause you're gonna be timeless""

To be remembered by the readers (Gonna be)
My generation's Mona Lisa (Gonna be)
Whoa, whoa oh, yeah (No, no, you're gonna be)
I'm not afraid to be a hero (Gonna be)
To be known wherever we go (Gonna be)
I was told I was a zero (Gonna be)
But no, no, no, no, no (You know you're gonna be)
And I can't sit and wait for all my plans

So don't worry about the records that I swap out
I'm reaching for that Goosebump shit from 
College Dropout
Never let opinions split me in two
I keep smiling and do what I do
""How he so quiet, but that dope shine through?""
Because it's humbling when your message is bigger than you
Yeah, I grew up in an internet age
With 10,000 freaking records on my internet page
It's kinda tought to not blend all the records I played
I'm just the one that's not afraid to make sickening lane
Yeah, shouts to Cudi just doing what feels right
Shouts to kids who don't know what they really like
'Cause we're the same, we're just making music every night
And we're the reason why these A&R's are getting fired

I wonder if I propose, will she open up like umbrellas
Or will she close, I would hope that you were in the know
Cause that dress is wrapping around her like plastic on bags of blow
She so classic, I never pass it, so passionate, making racket
When raggin', grabbin' her toes, a total package and all
Never get in your face about movin' in steady paces
Throw those other broads away, just so her waist don't go to waste
I'm the detective on this case, but I've defected on this record
Investigating a case and pursuing her in a chase
I might ruin her when I'm through with her, but only she would know
If I broke her heart into pieces and dropped it when it was frozen
And I'm a snowman, we hold hands, I melt when she gets close
Grabbin' my carrot, I'm an addict for this habit I have chosen
As the weather's getting warmer and the season is done
I'ma make sure to keep you on the tip of my tongue

Clap clap, clap clap, so what?

Still hung up on opinions, still tryna find a way home

Still feel like I'm behind time, still worry where the day goes

when the lions come,the_separation,"December 10, 2013","[Hook: Jon Bellion]
When the lions come and they turn to fight
Will you lose your soul?
Will you lose your pride?
Cause the only thing they needs
To smell a drop of fear inside
When the lions come, will you turn to fight?

[Verse 1: Shy Grey]
Yeah, they tried to stop me
Tried to box me in the ring but I'm rocky
Indeed I'mma rumble
If the lions come I am, uh
Gonna be deemed new king of the jungle
I came from the bottom where it's not a problem
You know they got iron and chrome
And they firing at domes
And they hold more grams than retirement homes
I made it out all on my own, the homies know I was alone
But they be calling my phone, if they need some money
In other words I was a loan, now I'm in the zone
Should have been another statistic
But I said fuck it I'll risk it
Looked death right in the face and I kissed it
No evidence and no trace of the lipstick
Now ain't nobody gonna stop me now
Ain't nobody gonna knock me down
I'm from the school of the hard knocks
Breaking doors down they tryna lock me out
If you stayed to fight then you might have won
But they caught your ass cause you tried to run
Me, Jon B, Blaque Keyz, in a fighting stance when the lions come

[Hook: Jon Bellion]
When the lions come and they turn to fight
Will you lose your soul?
Will you lose your pride?
Cause the only thing they needs
To smell a drop of fear inside
When the lions come, will you turn to fight?

[Verse 2: Logic]
Yeah, lemme get it like this, lemme rip it like this
So sick, don't spit, I vomit
Bomb it, wearing the freshest of garments
Blowing up yeah we the bombest
Never cocky i'm just honest, reppin' artanis—woah
Maryland what I be reppin' the second I step in
I murder like weapon
Let me bring the tech and I'll hit ya like Tekken, I'm gone
Whatever record I'm on, I just wreck it and I'm gone
R-A—double T—P-A-C-K, V's up, all day, yeah we do it our way
I push white keys like Beethoven, while Blaque Keyz drop 16's,
Like the sistine, that's so mean
Hell yeah, that's so clean
Can I get it? Lemme get it, I got to get it
I got to spit it from the heart, lemme tear it apart
Living the real life, everybody want to wonder what it feel like
Rock with a drop top, living on top, lemme get it
I get ready to pop, when they bopping they head
When they rocking' the bed
If I couldn't do this then I'd be dead

[Hook: Jon Bellion]
When the lions come and they turn to fight
Will you lose your soul?
Will you lose your pride?
Cause the only thing they needs
To smell a drop of fear inside
When the lions come, will you turn to fight?

[Verse 3: Blaque Keyz]
Man it's unreasonable to think that Keyz won't leave MC's extinct
I never had a reason to, until now
To get that spear and hit that Jeep?
See me swerving like Steve Irwin through herds of nervous MC's
I sink my teeth in their verses, each feature becomes a feast
Lay back, relax in my den, get paid from the royalties
And bring it back to the pack and just let my family eat
I'm a predator on this beat, every metaphor is my prey
My roar rumbles your feet, I'll place your head on my tray
I'm letting your girl pat me, run fingers all through my mane
The pride of a dying breed with ferocity in my veins
At the top of the food chain, the philosophy is the same
So live properly, so one day they won't throw you in no cage
Keyz is king of the jungle no rumbling with the snakes
You running when I'm on the prowl
I pounce you can't keep the pace
You know I've been earning stripes, got zebra print on my face
Got to make it apart of ya
See the world through my wardrobe like Narnia

From past loves that tried to screw me

And that corny theme song
Always plays when you're next to me
Like, ""Who you gonna call?""

There's someone gorgeous in my bed tonight

Until you're harder than sparring with Mayweather
With leather Spaldings
This is my calling, so I answer it with bars, but not for service
It's for hurting any person verses me
I've been rhyming since nurseries
Third degree burns, emerge from the furnace, get close to me
While I'm roasting one of these pigs, my flow is rotisserie
It's a pity that all these hoes slipping out of their hosiery
Won't get a hold of me, I slip through their fingers like Rosaries
Been waiting for you to find it
So I leave it where it's supposed to be
Cause once you see the genius, it's intimidating isn't it?

[Pre-Chorus: Blaque Keyz]
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Took a little while for your mind to find it
But once you see the genius, it's intimidating, isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it?

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
They told me that my attention span aligns
Somewhat with the child or a fly, yeah
They didn't understand that I saw signs
Hearing things, but now they realize
That the woman that I prayed for became my wife
And dreams that I wrote down, they came to life
I figured out there's money in my mind
I'm glad I lived my life pre-occupied

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
You need to get that bag out my face
God made me a full-blown genius
What the fuck I need coke for?
You need to get that bag out my face
God made me a full-blown genius
What the fuck I—

Holy verses in his kiss
He was your bible
You found nature in his lips
The sex was tribal
He brought purpose to your hips
Your soul's revival
Such a hopeful Eve
But Adam let you down

He played you fast and reined you in
No slow recital
You waited for him on the strip
But no arrival

I was a human, breathing and thinking
Eating and drinking, philosophizing
I was a human, before you killed me
And ripped my heart out, I knew what love was

[Pre-Chorus]
Now when they ask me, I just reply slow
And sound like an iPhone
I do not know love, I am a robot
Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
I do not know love, I am a robot
Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
I used to know love

[Chorus]
Cause I had a fire, passion and desire
Now all I require are circuits and wires
Inside was an ocean of soul and emotion
Then you cut me open, now all that I know is—

I am a robot, thoughtless and empty
Don't know who sent me, don't know who made me
Electric robot, everything's gray now
Numb to the pain now, I knew what love was

new york soul (part ii),the_human_condition,"June 20, 2016","[Chorus: Alec Benjamin]
Lay me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's own are smiling cause my soul is fine
I did everything for New York

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
New Yorker in California, packed Brooklyn up in this bag
I'm in Malibu with the Bronx, she's in Kevin love with your man
Kyrie needed a king, I'm just making you understand
What I rustle up in the West, cause my reach is Kevin Durant
Records are very pop with a pocket deeper than sand
A juxtaposition, Sam Cooke, Billy Joel, Steely Dan
Changing the fucking spectrum, I need you to understand
Like I took the fall for some drugs
I've been nominated for Grams (
It's Grammy's
)
Skinny genius got blueprints up in my hand
So the minute you hear my single, just know that it's in my plan
Advantage of demographics, I'm Jigga, Bruno and Sam Smith
I'm moving business, I'm Taylor Swift in a van
This game, boy, is very, very advanced
I'm very, very New York, be very, very aware
How very, very Di Nero, I can get on a snare
Letting go of your throat, I can sing the hook if you scared

[Chorus: Alec Benjamin]
Lay me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's own are smiling cause my soul is fine
I did everything for New York

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
Meet me in the red dress when the stakes high
That's porterhouse
She's 5 foot 9 in a Rolls Royce, that's Slaughterhouse
Benny Hahn, Hahn's and a tall boy, we ordered out
The hell you need a chaser when all this liquor is watered down?
Wait, see all them lines is fuck boy chat
Don't be so impressed by all that fuck boy rap
This money gon' leave you empty if you just want that
See, my joy lies in the Son and you should jump on that
She'll make you think that she the wife and that you found the one
But she just looking for some powder, not the talcum one
I’m not judging, here in the middle like I’m Malcolm, son
Verbal trigger like you should never play around with guns
Bow down to no crown, these dudes was out for the count
'Cause the Sour Diesel was loud, I was pounding bass in the lounge
Sober dope, moving proud, like allowance found in the crowd
When a thousand counting me out
But I'm here and killing the crowd now, blaow

[Chorus: Alec Benjamin]
Lay me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's own are smiling cause my soul is fine
I did everything for New York

Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you
 (Yeah)
Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you

[Verse 3: Jon Bellion]
Let me give the kids just a little help
Tell 'em money is not the key to wealth
'Cause if it can stop the pain
How the fuck do you explain a bunch of millionaires that killed themselves?
So you can take me off your winner's shelf
I got different vision, I'm bringing help
I know the demons in the room
Gon' say it's more that I can chew
But now all I hear is the dinner bell
I need a family that loves me right
Don't need a chain, don't need a club at night
I had a conversation with an angel
She told me I'd cheat death if I stayed away from the party life
Dropped off in the land where the artists play
Where God's way is the hardest way
Told myself I'm keeping my faith

Who walks around with a swagger of Kenny G

Snackin' on actors, so pass me a napkin
Chip on the shoulder, the kid is colder than both Dakotas

For honor and every day, I'm getting stronger

TUAMIE has developed a new hyperbolic time chamber
Here on Namek, we'll be focusing on the mental
Training starts now, begin

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
Ooh, I've just been fanning myself, I'm a such a fan of myself
There's levels to the cool like a fan on a shelf
When you blow, they try to gas you like fans at the Shell station
God hands me a full plate, but I handle it well
If they don't feel your thoughts, start dreaming in braille
They'll try to sell you short 'cause their dreams are for sale
They'll say ""Get off your podium, life isn't Nickelodeon""
""Orange you so dumb?"" Kenan and Kel, wow
The government leaves an animal trail
So I switch to swiss chard, carrots, and kale
So I'll remember my kid's name, dementia is a sick game
I'm silencing the lamb, call me Hannibal Failed, yeah
Financial plans should be handled in stealth
I fight to lead a private life for my family's health
Got some dinner with art collectors, they started drinkin' Prosecco
When they slipped about their level of family wealth
Bunch of actresses downplay how my records have felt
It's not a mystery to decode a fan in yourself
""This man's on fire,"" I can't pretend I'm not talented
For me to fake humble's a corny way to be arrogant
Drug dealers still on the corner of Madison
Except they push Pradas and Red Bottoms to Madisons
Red bottoms for baboons and radishes
I went to Mozambique and saw a real kind of happiness
So I don't feel guilty when Nike sends me some packages
We still end up in boxes even though we chase packagin', mm

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion & Christopher Sabat]
Take this, take this, TUAMIE supply the face lift, uh
Take this, take this, TUAMIE supply the face lift
I can't fall off, I got a great grip
Go and find some talent, have a great trip, uh
This Bellion guy's power level is amazing
Uh, take this, take this, TUAMIE supply the face lift, mm
Prepare to fight
My stance here as a band leader is Pangaea
My heart frío, I'm cold, heater than Cambria
I rock steady, my Johnson's Dwayne-heavy
We just erase heroes, I'll Stan Lee ya, Remini, he the king of Queens
My bars breathe Lebron's Kia, I carry greatness
Statements on spaceship, Haitians get LASIK
Meaning you dread what comes from my third eye
Blind to the fake shit (Wow)
My tone is gettin' aggressive
I just create for the truly gifted of adolescence
My essence becomes the mystery
I instantly become a Pistol Pete in a sport full of Walt Fraziers
My Kelsey Grammer is something like Thor with a hammer
Special-
Like Alfred Hitchcock with a camera
Beam-
Just Blaze and Killa Cam with a sample
Both hands on the candle, can't handle it
Cannon!
My channel too hot to cancel, my baby's drivin'
I'm Ansel
I'm passenger writin' stanzas, I'm holdin' these verses ransom
I'm Hansel Zoolander handsome
TUAMIE supply the face lift

[Verse 3: Jon Bellion & Christopher Sabat]
It's all because of (Jesus)
Well done, welcome to Glory Sound Prep
I'm lovin' it all, here with my brother-in-law
Greece is a beautiful place, food is incredible, awe
We just been playin' some games, everyone's pickin' a straw
Who gets the longest has gotta go tell the butler to call
For more alcohol
Wait, we'd told the locals that we'd go and play basketball
But they don't want the business
Plus, I drank from the flask we bought, now everything is spinnin'
Then we laugh it off
Ooh, it's Whoopi Goldberg the way that my sisters act up, uh
They had some champagne, now everybody's laughing
Movies 'bout paradise, and my family got the casting
If you dove into the tears of my eyes, you'd hear this instrumental
Jesus was instrumental in blessing my mental
Every time I drove a car, could've twisted the metal
Yeah, all the things on my wish list, God has given in triplets
I'm on an island where opiates go to rich kids
And then they pass away, that's called death over the privileged
Yeah, I never wanna be famous, stop calling me underrated
I'm still pushin' the same whip I was drivin' in Sachem, uh
Peace in my life, I'm on some As-salamu alaykum
I'm makin' certain decisions, I'm flyin' under the radar
I really love my life and this music thing is a great job
Yeah, pick up the phone and someone tells me, ""Mr. Bellion, sir
Beyoncé on the line, she tryna reach you on your cellular""
She wanted ""Fall In Line,"" but we gave it to Aguilera, uhh
I hope it's the right decision, Bey wanted it for the twins she signed
I hope I didn't burn that bridge, I worry all the time
I'm just tryna show these kids about this slight of mine
I always flex, but I realize that it's divine appointment
I'm a cross between hard work and Jesus-anointed
I hope the sinner that needed grace is the final notion
For the rest of my life, you'll see me on the L-I-double R
With a Heineken in my bag, on my way to the Garden
Tryin' to kill your nephews like I been fuckin' with Scar

cautionary tales,glory_sound_prep,"November 9, 2018","[Verse 1]
Heard he was born as a beast and a ghost
On the East of a coast where they eat you for jokes, uh
I know a guy who said his mom knew a man
Whose mother's sister saw him in the mall one time
Heard he was 
high
 and 
he rode to the sky
And it opened
 and 
God played a song
 he recorded
He wrote it down
But he only play the record for his wife sometimes
Heard he survived, on an island with Vikes
That provided the Valkyries, sirens, and pirates
Don’t know the guy, yeah, uh
But they talk about his verses in the night sometimes

[Chorus]
Big bang, the six, the seven
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the six, the seven
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the king, the legend

[Verse 2]
Heard he was formed from the lights that are Northern
The Rock of Gibraltar, he once got an offer
From Lucifer's daughter to bow to the gods
So he'd keep his verses
 sharper than a knife sometimes
Heard he was warned that a hero gets torn
Between fame and adornment and loses his sword
So he shot the fame down, uh
But he keep a mask on him if the sign’s in the sky
Heard he was happy so no one could gas him
Or force him to dance like a monkey for assets
He loves his life
But he keep a pen sharp enough to write one time

[Chorus]
Big bang, the six, the seven
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the six, the seven

Big bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the king, the legend

He struck down gods and he killed an army
Stood up on top of a hill of bodies
It was never enough

he just needed saving from himself
Put up both hands, 
made the lightning come down

You already know how we came up
I'm saying it was a real pain in the butt (Ow)
If it's paper to touch, we may just cut you, scraping it up
Get your trachea cut and then escape in a truck
Smudge a lady makeup, bang the trey-eighty, wake the baby up
I just came for the weight like a gymnasium
I'm finna spray everything in my radius
Lately, my skin been looking radiant
The Mercedes is eighties sent
I have three sixes in my fate like Damien
I'd die before I let the jakes take me in
Babe, we everything we say we is (Facts)
My stable of women couldn't fit in the stadium
They sayin' me and Jon Bellion, we some aliens
And durags had us looking like Saudi Arabians
Your wave miscellaneous, we some ladies men
It's Roc, Marcberg be the alias
Now let's begin

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
Was never focused on gettin' bigger, just gettin' better
That's why I keep gettin' bigger after every record
Said I got lucky, the last record that y'all was blessed with
Watch me give you sequels, I'm Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon
I let the talent speak volumes, that's why there's different levels
I stopped the flexin' on socials, corny shit to impress you
You get too famous, then everything in your life is stressful
There's a big difference 'tween being known and being successful
Great grandfather, an immigrant from the Naples district
Dirty Guinea crew in the cut, call that the true incision
My wife thicker than liquor soaked in Italian biscuits
Cookin' minestron' every Sunday, call that a superstition
I left LA just to cook in Brooklyn, the winter's reaper
I sleep in Timbs and a Yankee fitted, that's just for leisure
I'm really better than everybody pretends to be
So ask the label now, why the fuck would I want an urban feature?
""I love the song and we really wanna know how you made it""
Or I could keep all you wondering how we been creatin'
It's annoying when cameras catchin' your every statement
And I've had enough of these corny artists that replicate it
Champagne supernovas destroy the morning glory
I'd rather build an oasis sober and thrive at 40
Don't get me wrong, I've been celebrating the life before me
But I see the wisdom in moderation for certain stories
When you're afraid to hurt feelings, you water down the worth
I'm done pretending your record's great and I'm down to work
Plus, I'll be actress and mixed with sociopaths
And when I'm worried about being famous for being down to earth
I spoke with Yahweh, he told me Jesus grafted us in
Which means my brother's my brother, it don't matter the skin
America needs to watch how they treat His chosen people
But that's for deeper than surface records, now let's begin

[Chorus: RZA & B.Keyz]
Now let's begin
Yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, uh
Now let's begin

[Verse 3: B.Keyz]
Uh, foot on the gas, foot on your neck, uh
One mashin', other gasping for a breath
I'm unclasped, capital punishment blast backwards
You tumblin', trash rappers who mumblin' for respect
I'm uncheckable, wide open, the foul technical
Go full press, I still glide like Clyde Drexler do
I'm done testin' two times over, I'll get the best of you
Better pay attention, two eyes open wide when I execute
And I been waiting so long that you asked for this
Try to give me your table scraps, I'ma give you my ass to kiss
I won't even wait for the dap, you'll get faded right after this
A masochist who ready to face the masses like Catholics, uh
And you can tell the whole school I'm prepped for the glory
In the presence of your professor, attendance is mandatory
With a weapon, freshman semester, you test the mess, it get gory
I'm just here to kill the game, let the messenger tell the story

And the love I fought to feel was always free?
What if all the things I've done (What if all the things I've done)
Were just attempts at earning love?
But the hole inside my heart is stupid deep, oh, stupid deep

[Outro]

No real estate in the real world
