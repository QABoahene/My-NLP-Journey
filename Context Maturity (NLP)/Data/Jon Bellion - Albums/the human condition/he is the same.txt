[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
Still living in his dad's house, 24 years old
He could buy a few pads, but he just like to stay home
No, he never took the fast route, now the plaqueâ€™s on deck
But they still make him take the trash out, keep his ass in check

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Same kids from the high school (Same kids from the high school)
Jump shot still flame (Jump shot still flame)
Couple million in the bank, but (Couple million in the bank, but)

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Nothing has changed, he is the same
(Dum, da, da-dum, da-da-da, da-dum, da-da-da, da-dum, dum)
(Dum, da, da-dum, da-da-da, dum)
Nothing has changed, he is the same
(Dum, da, da-dum, da-da-da, da-dum, da-da-da, da-dum, dum)
(Dum, da, da-dum, da-da-da, dum)
Nothing has changed, he is the same

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
His assistant is his best friend, lost his dad that day
Really puts it in perspective: What the fuck's a bad day?
Sister told him, "Keep your head right," 24 years old
Real women need love, fake bitches want gold

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Same kids from the high school (Same kids from the high school)
Jump shot still flame (Jump shot still flame)
Couple million in the bank, but (Couple million in the bank, but)

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Nothing has changed, he is the same
(Dum, da, da-dum, da-da-da, da-dum, da-da-da, da-dum, dum)
(Dum, da, da-dum, da-da-da, dum)
Nothing has changed, he is the same
(Dum, da, da-dum, da-da-da, da-dum, da-da-da, da-dum, dum)
(Dum, da, da-dum, da-da-da, dum)
Nothing has changed, he is the same

[Verse 3: Jon Bellion]
All he needed was a platform, built a real fan base
Took 'em with him when the deal came, selling out in every state
Signed a deal after his first tape, but he kept it on the low
They could never say he sold out, that's why they come to every show

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Same kids from the high school (Same kids from the high school)
Jump shot still flame (Jump shot still flame)
Couple million in the bank, but (Couple million in the bank, but)

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Nothing has changed, he is the same
(Dum, da, da-dum, da-da-da, da-dum, da-da-da, da-dum, dum)
(Dum, da, da-dum, da-da-da, dum)
Nothing has changed, he is the same
(Dum, da, da-dum, da-da-da, da-dum, da-da-da, da-dum, dum)
(Dum, da, da-dum, da-da-da, dum)

[Outro: Audra Mae]
Nothing has changed, we are the same
Nothing has changed, nothing
All the same, we are the same
Nothing has changed, we are the same
We are the same
