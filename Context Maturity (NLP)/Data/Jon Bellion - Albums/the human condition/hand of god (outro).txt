[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
My head spins, I've been sipping
I've been sipping, I've been sipping lately
All my sins, I've been tripping, I've been tripping, my God
Brand new life, I've been looking
I've been looking, I've been looking lately
All these nights, they've been cooking
They've been cooking me raw

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
I am just a man, I am just a man who lusts, gives, tries
Sometimes, I lose my way

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
Angry at all the things, angry at all the things I can't change
When you're lost in the universe, lost in the universe, don't lose faith
My mother says, "Your whole life's in the hand of God"

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Break it down
Your whole life's in the hand of...
Your whole life's in the hand of God

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
My ex girl, I've been seeing
I've been seeing, I've been seeing lately
She's got hopes that we're getting back together, my God
I just know that I'm horny and I'm lonely, just admit it's crazy
She just holds on to something that she knows is long gone
Damn

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
I am just a man, I am just a man who lusts, gives, tries
Sometimes, I lose my way

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
Angry at all the things, angry at all the things I can't change
When you're lost in the universe, lost in the universe, don't lose faith
My mother says, "Your whole life's in the hand of God"

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Break it down
Your whole life's in the hand of...
Your whole life's in the hand of God

[Chorus: Sheldon Ray 
& The Andre Crouch Choir
]
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
Angry at all the things, angry at all the things I can't change
When you're lost in the universe, lost in the universe, don't lose faith
My mother said, "Your, 
your whole life is in the hand of God
"

[Outro: Sheldon Ray & 
The Andre Crouch Choir

Nothing has changed, he is the same
"Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Nothing has changed, he is the same
"Your whole life's in the hand of God"
"Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
Nothing has changed
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
"Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
I might break
Angry at all the things, angry at all the things I can't change
Angry at all the things I could not change
When you're lost in the universe, lost in the universe, don't lose faith
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
My mother says, "Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Overwhelming
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Overwhelming
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
"Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Lay me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Long Islandâ€™s only smiling cause my soul is fine
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
I did everything for New York
