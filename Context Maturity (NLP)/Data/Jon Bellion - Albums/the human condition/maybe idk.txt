[Verse 1]
I wonder why I get paranoid when I'm high
I wonder why I say yes to everyone in my life
I wonder why I can't run that fast in my dreams
I wonder why I feel short when I know my money's tall
I wonder why I miss everyone and I still don't call
I wonder why I can't run that fast in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Although I guess if I knew tomorrow
I guess I wouldn't need faith
I guess if I never fell
I guess I wouldn't need grace
I guess if I knew His plans
I guess He wouldn't be God, God, God

[Chorus]
So maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
Maybe that's okay, maybe that's okay
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay

[Verse 2]
I wonder why I feel emptiness and I sing these blues
I wonder why I feel hopelessness when I watch the news
I wonder why I can't find my voice in my dreams
I wonder why they say hate your brother and hide your gold
I wonder why we all fear the things that we might not know
I wonder why I can't find my voice in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Although I guess if I knew tomorrow
I guess I wouldn't need faith
I guess if I never fell
I guess I wouldn't need grace
I guess if I knew His plans
I guess He wouldn't be God, God, God

[Chorus]
So maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
Maybe that's okay, maybe that's okay
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay

[Bridge]
All this shit, I can't explain
Is it by design or random fate, yeah

[Chorus]
So maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
Maybe that's okay, maybe that's okay
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
