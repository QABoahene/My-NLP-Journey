[Verse 1]
I was a human, breathing and thinking
Eating and drinking, philosophizing
I was a human, before you killed me
And ripped my heart out, I knew what love was

[Pre-Chorus]
Now when they ask me, I just reply slow
And sound like an iPhone
I do not know love, I am a robot
Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
I do not know love, I am a robot
Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
I used to know love

[Chorus]
Cause I had a fire, passion and desire
Now all I require are circuits and wires
Inside was an ocean of soul and emotion
Then you cut me open, now all that I know isâ€”

[Verse 2]
I am a robot, thoughtless and empty
Don't know who sent me, don't know who made me
Electric robot, everything's gray now
Numb to the pain now, I knew what love was

[Pre-Chorus]
Now when they ask me, I just reply slow
And sound like an iPhone
I do not know love, I am a robot
Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
I do not know love, I am a robot
Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
I used to know love

[Chorus]
Cause I had a fire, passion and desire
Now all I require are circuits and wires
Inside was an ocean of soul and emotion
Then you cut me open, now all that I know is

[Bridge]
I am a robot
(Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba)
I am a robot
(Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba)
I used to know love

[Chorus]
Cause I had a fire, passion and desire
Now all I require are circuits and wires
Inside was an ocean of soul and emotion
Then you cut me open, now all that I know is

[Outro]
I am a robot
