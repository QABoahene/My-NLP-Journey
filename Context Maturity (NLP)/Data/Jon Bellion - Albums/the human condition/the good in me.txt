[Intro]
1, 2, 3—1, 2, 3
1, 2, 3—1, 2, 3—1, 2, 3

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
You know that he trusts you and I know that he loves you
But somehow you convinced me again
My foundation rumbles and all my morals crumble
My father's warnings run through my head

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Your heart's a vine that I've bled trying to climb
Yeah, you're making a ruin of me
Try to survive, keep my spirit alive
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
One temptation sparked this
Now I can feel the darkness
It's my own fault, but you had this planned
All of me, you take now, like criminals and shakedowns
Yeah, you make me forget who I am

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Your heart's a vine that I've bled trying to climb
Yeah, you're making a ruin of me
Try to survive, keep my spirit alive
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me

[Bridge: Kimberly Perry]
All of your good is mine
All of your good is mine
All of your good is mine
All of your good is mine

[Outro: Jon Bellion]
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me, hey
