[Intro]
Is this the American?
Is this the American?
Is this the American?
Is this the Ameâ€“

[Chorus]
Woke up in London with you next to me
Made love in Brixton with both hands around your neck
I'm back in New York on British ecstasy
So I feel like an immigrant in America
Yes, I am just an immigrant in America

[Verse 1]
Cigar and cigarette ashes
As I open all my luggage up
I still speak my native language
But I only want your foreign tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember? Remember?
When you spilled coffee on my J
Coffee on my J Dilla vinyl
I didn't even mind, didn't even mind (crazy)
When you spilled coffee on my J
Coffee on my J Dilla vinyl
I didn't even mind, didn't even mind (baby)

[Chorus]
Woke up in London with you next to me
Made love in Brixton with both hands around your neck
I'm back in New York on British ecstasy
So, I feel like an immigrant in America
Yes, I am just an immigrant in America

[Verse 2]
South London, born in Colombia
Texts in Spanish that she's all alone
She said she's found an apartment
I'm in Harlem, screaming, "take me home"

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember? Remember?
When you spilled coffee on my J
Coffee on my J Dilla vinyl
I didn't even mind, didn't even mind (crazy)
When you spilled coffee on my J
Coffee on my J Dilla vinyl
I didn't even mind, didn't even mind (baby)

[Outro]
Woke up in London with you next to me
Made love in Brixton with both hands around your neck
I'm back in New York on British ecstasy
So, I feel like an immigrant in America, I miss you
Yes, I feel like an immigrant in America, that's how I feel...
