[Verse 1]
You say your tribe's from Kentucky—tucky
Give you three days if you're lucky, lucky
These Wall Street dogs they can smell ya, smell ya
But in my tent there is shelter, shelter

[Pre-Chorus]
I will take care of you
Put the heat down, put the heat down, down
So please don't be scared of me
Put the heat down, put the heat down, down

[Chorus]
The lion is creeping
But you will be sleeping sound
Cause you're too pretty
You're, you're too pretty
And New York City is a jungle out there
Jungle out there, jungle out there
New York City, it's a jungle out there
Jungle out there, jungle out there
I said New York City it's a jungle out there

[Verse 2]
Sharks moving white on these corners, corners
No woods but trees like the forest, forest
You're not from here they can smell ya, smell ya
But in my tent there is shelter, shelter

[Pre-Chorus]
I will take care of you
Put the heat down, put the heat down, down
So please don't be scared of me
Put the heat down, put the heat down, down

[Chorus]
The lion is creeping
But you will be sleeping sound
Cause you're too pretty
You're, you're too pretty
And New York City is a jungle out there
Jungle out there, jungle out there
New York City, it's a jungle out there
Jungle out there, jungle out there
I said New York City it's a jungle out there

[Bridge]
Listen close...
These models don't mean soda when they're offering coke
There's quicksand in this night life, it will swallow you whole
You sound so 'effing cute when you ask me, "What is blow?"
Singing, "New York city is a jungle out there..."

[Outro]
I will take care of you
So please don't be scared of me
Yes love, the lion is creeping
But you will be sleeping sound
