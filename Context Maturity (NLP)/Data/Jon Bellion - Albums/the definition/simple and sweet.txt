[Verse 1]
Way before you came, I was hollow, hollow, hollow
Used to complicate, now I'm alright, alright, I'm fine
All I gotta do now is follow, follow, follow
Used to complicate, now I'm alright, alright, I'm fine

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't need no big production
The synth and just my voice is fine (Yeah)
You don't need to wear your makeup up, no, no
No need to mess with God's design

[Chorus]
You're just so simple and sweet
(No yeah, no yeah, no yeah)
You're just so simple and sweet
(No yeah, no yeah, no yeah)
You're just so simple and sweet
(No yeah, no yeah, no yeah)
You're just so simple and sweet
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lets keep this simple and sweet

[Verse 2]
Way before you came, I was empty, empty, empty
Used to complicate, now I'm alright, alright, I'm fine
All you gotta do now is tell me, tell me, tell me
Used to complicate, now I'm alright, alright, I'm fine

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't need no big production
The synth and just my voice is fine
You don't need to wear your makeup up, no, no
No need to mess with God's design

[Chorus]
You're just so simple and sweet
(No yeah, no yeah, no yeah)
You're just so simple and sweet
(No yeah, no yeah, no yeah)
You're just so simple and sweet
(No yeah, no yeah, no yeah)
You're just so simple and sweet
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lets keep this simple and sweet

[Outro]
But if things get complicated
Don't worry, we gon' take it slow
Uh-uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
But if things get complicated
Don't worry, we gon' take it slow
Uh-uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
We keep it simple and sweet
Sing it out like...
Na, na-na-na, na, na-na, na-na
Na, na-na-na, na, na-na, na-na
Na, na-na-na, na, na-na, na-na
Na, na-na-na, na, na-na, na-na
