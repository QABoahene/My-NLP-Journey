[Verse 1]
Such haunting nightmares
From past loves that tried to screw me
But you were the preacher in an exorcism movie, my love
And that corny theme song
Always plays when you're next to me
Like, "Who you gonna call?"

[Chorus]
The ghosts of my exes they cry, "Oh, oh"
Cause they know that's it's their time to go, oh oh oh
The ghosts of my exes they cry, "Oh, oh"
They know that it's their time to go, oh oh oh
Cause since you walked on through my door
This ain't no haunted house no more

[Verse 2]
You took my hand and walked me into my dark attic
That's where my heart was lost and frozen in a casket, my love
My soul was mummified, you helped me to unwrap it
It's you I'm gonna call

[Chorus]
The ghosts of my exes they cry, "Oh, oh"
Cause they know that's it's their time to go, oh oh oh
The ghosts of my exes they cry, "Oh, oh"
They know that it's their time to go, oh oh oh
Cause since you walked on through my door
This ain't no haunted house no more

[Bridge]
I've been saved
Watch them all fall back into the grave
I've been saved
Watch them all fall back into the grave

[Chorus]
The ghosts of my exes they cry, "Oh, oh"
Cause they know that's it's their time to go, oh oh oh
The ghosts of my exes they cry, "Oh, oh"
They know that it's their time to go, oh oh oh
Cause since you walked on through my door
This ain't no haunted house no more
