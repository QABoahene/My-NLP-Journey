hats\\nLose the phone, never that\\nMy mother's cooking sauce\\nI'm more Italian than Sinatra's kids\\nFashion is a chore to me, I'm partying in moccasins\\nRocking with the scholars, then we shots up with the college kids\\nPlease don't try and copy me, you're cheating while I'm proctoring\\nPositively optimistic, hopping on the opposite\\nOf every single thing they ever told me to do\\nSo put the hate down and watch me spazz out\\nTo sounds that John Lennon would be proud of\\nPut the hate down and watch me spazz out\\nTo sounds that Jon Lennon would be proud\\n\\n[Chorus: Jon Bellion]\\nOh,

proper introduction\\nThis is Keyz without the locksmith\\nA new year, I'm tired of rapping on that nonchalant tip\\nYou scholars think you can roast my associate with hot shit?\\nYou're hopeless, 'cause this bachelor is a master when a doc spits\\nWork all day and lay back collecting bills at night\\nWe're fly enough to make the sell see us, still we're fearing heights\\nWaiting to blow, getting impatient\\nI've been chasing Mr. Myers with a knife\\nFlipping the script because I'm killing mics\\nMy entourage is a bunch of guys who walk around\\nMauling over moms in every mall with their sharpened claws\\nNot talking Santa or a certain type of grammar\\nI'm a standout, not handing handouts to all your open paws\\nSo put the hate down and watch me spazz out\\nTo sounds that Kurtis Blow would be proud of\\nPut the hate down and watch me spazz out\\nTo sounds that Kurtis Blow would be proud\\n\\n[Chorus: Jon Bellion]\\nOh, as I take off on an aeroplane\\nI realize the

like, high like)\\nI needed her, I knew she needed me\\nIf we fly this thing, it's gonna take two people\\nBut the storm came fast, got a little rocky\\nThe oxygen masks from the ceiling, they were dropping\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nWe started to fall right out the sky without a warning call\\nWe started to fall, no parachute\\nSo we had no time to call for mayday, mayday\\nWe booked two tickets down to paradise\\nOne last flight tryna make it right\\nBut that's when the rain came, that's when the pain came\\nWere never ever gonna make it fly\\nWe booked two tickets down to paradise\\nOne last flight tryna make it right\\nBut love came like a hurricane and we were just a paper plane\\nI know we tried to fly away, yeah\\nBut we were just a paper plane\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nIt's funny how things end up, it's funny how we break it off\\nRelationships they nose dive while one's career is taking off\\nPublishing checks and fake smiles as I see my dad\\nMy pockets getting filled, but really, emptiness is all I have\\nWe crash, and now there's spare parts\\nBandages, and bad scars\\nWe're trying to mend broke Amelia Earharts\\nAnd keep trying to fly on, fly on, fly on\\nBut I'm missing my right wing, my right arm, and that's you\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nWe started to fall right out the sky without a warning call\\nWe started to fall, no parachute\\nSo we had no time to call for mayday, mayday\\nWe booked

down\\nSo please don't be scared of me\\nPut the heat down, put the heat down, down\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nThe lion is creeping\\nBut you will be sleeping sound\\nCause you're too pretty\\nYou're, you're too pretty\\nAnd New York City is a jungle out there\\nJungle out there, jungle out there\\nNew York City, it's a jungle out there\\nJungle out there, jungle out there\\nI said New York City it's a jungle out there\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nListen close...\\nThese models don't mean soda when they're offering coke\\nThere's quicksand in this night life, it will swallow you whole\\nYou sound so 'effing cute when you ask me, \"What is blow?\"\\nSinging, \"New York city is a jungle out there...\"\\n\\n[Outro]\\nI will take care of you\\nSo please don't be scared of me\\nYes love, the lion is creeping\\nBut you

making you understand\\nWhat I rustle up in the West, cause my reach is Kevin Durant\\nRecords are very pop with a pocket deeper than sand\\nA juxtaposition, Sam Cooke, Billy Joel, Steely Dan\\nChanging the fucking spectrum, I need you to understand\\nLike I took the fall for some drugs\\nI've been nominated for Grams (\\nIt's Grammy's\\n)\\nSkinny genius got blueprints up in my hand\\nSo the minute you hear my single, just know that it's in my plan\\nAdvantage of demographics, I'm Jigga, Bruno and Sam Smith\\nI'm moving business, I'm Taylor Swift in a van\\nThis game, boy, is very, very advanced\\nI'm very, very New York, be very, very aware\\nHow very, very Di Nero, I can get on a snare\\nLetting go of your throat, I can sing the hook if you scared\\n\\n[Chorus: Alec

2: Jon Bellion]\\nMeet me in the red dress when the stakes high\\nThat's porterhouse\\nShe's 5 foot 9 in a Rolls Royce, that's Slaughterhouse\\nBenny Hahn, Hahn's and a tall boy, we ordered out\\nThe hell you need a chaser when all this liquor is watered down?\\nWait, see all them lines is fuck boy chat\\nDon't be so impressed by all that fuck boy rap\\nThis money gon' leave you empty if you just want that\\nSee, my joy lies in the Son and you should jump on that\\nShe'll make you think that she the wife and that you found the one\\nBut she just looking for some powder, not the talcum one\\nI’m not judging, here in the middle like I’m Malcolm, son\\nVerbal trigger like you should never play around with guns\\nBow down to no crown, these dudes was out for the count\\n'Cause the Sour Diesel was loud, I was pounding bass in the lounge\\nSober dope, moving proud, like allowance found in the crowd\\nWhen a thousand counting me out\\nBut I'm here and killing the crowd now,

help\\nTell 'em money is not the key to wealth\\n'Cause if it can stop the pain\\nHow the fuck do you explain a bunch of millionaires that killed themselves?\\nSo you can take me off your winner's shelf\\nI got different vision, I'm bringing help\\nI know the demons in the room\\nGon' say it's more that I can chew\\nBut now all I hear is the dinner bell\\nI need a family that loves me right\\nDon't need a chain, don't need a club at night\\nI had a conversation with an angel\\nShe told me I'd cheat death if I stayed away from the party life\\nDropped off in the land where the

die\\nThere is an ocean in your hips, so deep, I'd dive\\nI hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life\\nYeah, I think I got one\\nAnd every single little thing about her is so—\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nOverwhelming\\nEverything about you is so overwhelming\\nWhen I think about you, it gets overwhelming\\n'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming\\nCome over here and overwhelm me\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nYou write checks that my ass can't cash\\nI bit a little more than I can chew\\nI bit a little more than I can chew\\nYou write checks that my ass can't cash\\nI bit a little more than I can chew\\nI bit a little more than I can chew\\n'Cause everything about you is so—\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nOverwhelming\\nEverything about you is so overwhelming\\nWhen I think about you, it gets overwhelming\\n'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming\\nCome over here and overwhelm me

hands me a full plate, but I handle it well\\nIf they don't feel your thoughts, start dreaming in braille\\nThey'll try to sell you short 'cause their dreams are for sale\\nThey'll say \"Get off your podium, life isn't Nickelodeon\"\\n\"Orange you so dumb?\" Kenan and Kel, wow\\nThe government leaves an animal trail\\nSo I switch to swiss chard, carrots, and kale\\nSo I'll remember my kid's name, dementia is a sick game\\nI'm silencing the lamb, call me Hannibal Failed, yeah\\nFinancial plans should be handled in stealth\\nI fight to lead a private life for my family's health\\nGot some dinner with art collectors, they started drinkin' Prosecco\\nWhen they slipped about their level of family wealth\\nBunch of actresses downplay how my records have felt\\nIt's not a mystery to decode a fan in yourself\\n\"This man's on fire,\" I can't pretend I'm not talented\\nFor me to fake humble's a corny way to be arrogant\\nDrug dealers still on the corner of Madison\\nExcept they push Pradas and Red Bottoms to Madisons\\nRed bottoms for baboons and radishes\\nI went to Mozambique and saw a real kind of happiness\\nSo I don't feel guilty when Nike sends me some packages\\nWe still end up in boxes even though we chase packagin', mm\\n\\n[Verse 2: Jon Bellion & Christopher Sabat]\\nTake this, take this, TUAMIE supply the face lift, uh\\nTake this, take this, TUAMIE supply the face lift\\nI
