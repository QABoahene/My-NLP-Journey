In this project, I used the Google Cloud Language Python API to perform sentiment analysis and entity recognition analysis on the transcript of the debate between President Donald Trump and Vice President (Former) and Presidential candidate Joe Biden. 
The idea was to practice codes for the above tasks  and also get to see how the outputs of the tasks above can summarize the debate.  
From the sentiment analysis on the document, the debate was flagged as **negative** (see below).
